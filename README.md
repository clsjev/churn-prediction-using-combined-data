# churn-prediction-using-AWS-samples

This project uses the idea of "aws-samples churn-prediction-with-text-and-interpretability" (from https://github.com/aws-samples/churn-prediction-with-text-and-interpretability/blob/main/README.md)

The categorical and numerical data is from Kaggle: E-Commerce Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anaghapaul/e-commerce-dataset), combined with a synthetic text dataset we created mainly using Google Gemini 2.5 flash.
