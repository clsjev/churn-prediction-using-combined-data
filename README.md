# Churn prediction using combined data

This project uses the idea of "aws-samples churn-prediction-with-text-and-interpretability" (from https://github.com/aws-samples/churn-prediction-with-text-and-interpretability/blob/main/README.md), but tries to use the DistilBERT model and XGBoost together instead of Fully Connected Neural Network.

The categorical and numerical data is from Kaggle: E-Commerce Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anaghapaul/e-commerce-dataset), combined with a synthetic text dataset created mainly using Gemini-2.5-flash.
